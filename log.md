# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 03, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I've reviewed several FreeCodeCamp exercises.

**Thoughts:** I'm using codepen.io to create an HTML log of notes as I go through these exercises, putting into practice what I'm learning by coding. It's fun!

### Day 2: January 04, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I've continued reviewing several FreeCodeCamp exercises. I also tinkered with elements of a tribute page.

**Thoughts:** I know that many days will not be like this one, but today I was excited to sit and work through more exercises and though my time is up for the day, I'm already looking forward to tomorrow. Code on!

### Day 3: January 05, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I've continued reviewing several FreeCodeCamp exercises.

**Thoughts:** I'm still having fun reviewing exercises and re-creating simple examples of what I'm learning via HTML in codepen.

### Day 4: January 06, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I've continued reviewing several more FreeCodeCamp exercises.

**Thoughts:** Over the hour, I encountered many 'aw yeah!' and 'oh that's right!' moments. Reviewing and reinforcing what I've learned with practice. So fun!

### Day 5: January 07, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I've continued reviewing several more FreeCodeCamp exercises.

**Thoughts:** I progressed through further review of FCC exercises. My note-taking wasn't as complete this time as it has been on prior days. Perhaps tomorrow I'll make a special codepen to quiz myself.

### Day 6: January 08, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Created a very basic HTML/CSS page to practice some lessons I learned yesterday.

**Thoughts:** I kept yesterday's promise. Funny part, to me, was that the hour I put in zoomed by. And now I am hungry.

### Day 7: January 09, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed more FCC exercises today. (BONUS: Coded initial outline of Wind Chimes track in Sonic Pi earlier today.)

**Thoughts:** I didn't feel like taking notes, though after today's review process, I know I'll need to practice to retain what I learned. Low energy today, but still having fun.

### Day 8: January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Practiced using Bootstrap on my basic HTML/CSS page to apply what I learned/reviewed yesterday.

**Thoughts:** Took my code on the road. Treated myself to a late lunch, then took advantage of the WiFi while in the away environment.
