# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 03, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I've reviewed several FreeCodeCamp exercises.

**Thoughts:** I'm using codepen.io to create an HTML log of notes as I go through these exercises, putting into practice what I'm learning by coding. It's fun!

### Day 2: January 04, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I've continued reviewing several FreeCodeCamp exercises. I also tinkered with elements of a tribute page.

**Thoughts:** I know that many days will not be like this one, but today I was excited to sit and work through more exercises and though my time is up for the day, I'm already looking forward to tomorrow. Code on!

### Day 3: January 05, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I've continued reviewing several FreeCodeCamp exercises.

**Thoughts:** I'm still having fun reviewing exercises and re-creating simple examples of what I'm learning via HTML in codepen.

### Day 4: January 06, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I've continued reviewing several more FreeCodeCamp exercises.

**Thoughts:** Over the hour, I encountered many 'aw yeah!' and 'oh that's right!' moments. Reviewing and reinforcing what I've learned with practice. So fun!
