# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 03, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I've reviewed several FreeCodeCamp exercises.

**Thoughts:** I'm using codepen.io to create an HTML log of notes as I go through these exercises, putting into practice what I'm learning by coding. It's fun!

### Day 2: January 04, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I've continued reviewing several FreeCodeCamp exercises. I also tinkered with elements of a tribute page.

**Thoughts:** I know that many days will not be like this one, but today I was excited to sit and work through more exercises and though my time is up for the day, I'm already looking forward to tomorrow. Code on!

### Day 4: January 06, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I've continued reviewing several more FreeCodeCamp exercises.

### Day 5: January 07, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I've continued reviewing several more FreeCodeCamp exercises.

**Thoughts:** I progressed through further review of FCC exercises. My note-taking wasn't as complete this time as it has been on prior days. Perhaps tomorrow I'll make a special codepen to quiz myself.

### Day 6: January 08, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Created a very basic HTML/CSS page to practice some lessons I learned yesterday.

**Thoughts:** I kept yesterday's promise. Funny part, to me, was that the hour I put in zoomed by. And now I am hungry.

### Day 7: January 09, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed more FCC exercises today. (BONUS: Coded initial outline of Wind Chimes track in Sonic Pi earlier today.)

**Thoughts:** I didn't feel like taking notes, though after today's review process, I know I'll need to practice to retain what I learned. Low energy today, but still having fun.

### Day 8: January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Practiced using Bootstrap on my basic HTML/CSS page to apply what I learned/reviewed yesterday.

**Thoughts:** Took my code on the road. Treated myself to a late lunch, then took advantage of the WiFi while in the away environment.

### Day 9: January 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added Font Awesome CDN to my basic HTML/CSS page. Practiced adding new icons. Practiced adding links to Bootstrap buttons.

**Thoughts:** Coding for me this morning, believe it or not, was a stress reliever. Through these practice sessions I'm forming a clearer plan for my tribute page project.

### Day 10: January 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Tinkered with some more HTML and Font Awesome icons on a practice page. Spent the rest of my time constructing a rhythmic square wave track in Sonic Pi.

**Thoughts:** Today was one of those days where my overall pace took a hit thanks to other matters stealing my focus. I pushed through, but it was not pretty.

**Link to work:** N/A - Will share the Square track when I'm ready to share it.


### Day 11: January 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued HTML practice on basic page. Reviewed responsive radio buttons. Paved way for some jQuery practice tomorrow by adding multiple wells and buttons to the page.

**Thoughts**: Being in a better mood today made the time fly by and I'm already looking forward to more practice tomorrow.

### Day 12: January 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Played with buttons! Added jQuery & Animate.css to my practice page. Practiced using various jQuery functions, including addClass, removeClass, html, css, prop, remove, clone, appendTo, parent, and children.

**Thoughts**: Wow. Just scratching the surface, I'm sure, but I'm blown away by what jQuery can be able to accomplish. Can't wait to play with it more!

### Day 13: January 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Spent over an hour (so far) revising my rhythmic square wave track in Sonic Pi. Learned a few new tricks which allowed me to remove many lines of code while preserving the composition. Same song, less verbose.

**Thoughts**: Coding in Sonic Pi tickles me to no end. I smile dreaming of the possibilities that will come with continued practice.

**Link to work:** N/A - Will share the Square track when I'm ready to share it.


### Day 14: January 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Spent another hour coding to learn how to play chord-based arpeggios in Sonic Pi. Got a great start on a new melody. Also spent some time trying to get a better understanding of using GitHub by creating a new repository in which to store/update my HTML practice pages.

**Thoughts**: I am excited about what I'm learning in both Sonic Pi and what I learned about GitHub, too. Good stuff all around.

**Link to work:** N/A - Will share the Arp track when I'm ready to share it, perhaps in a new Sonic Pi repository :)


### Day 15: January 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed some jQuery practice work by coding my own examples on my practice page. Made some copies of the practice pages and added them to my new HTML-Doodles repo on GitHub.

**Thoughts**: Next stop, FCC Tribute Page challenge. It's going to be fun!

**Link to work:**: TBA


### Day 16: January 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today was another Sonic Pi day. Continued coding a new TB303 track. Discovered :wobble and :panslicer FX as well as :wave and :smooth variables - I am in love!

**Thoughts**: Coding in Sonic Pi is a joy that brings me joy.

**Link to work**: Forthcoming


### Day 17: January 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today I spent all of my time coding/experimenting with drum patterns in Sonic Pi.

**Thoughts**: Editing and experimenting can be slow-going while I'm learning. I'm not discouraged - just coming to terms with reality. This will take time to master.

**Link to work**: Forthcoming


### Day 18: January 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Most of my time today was spent trying to devise how to set up borders to my liking for my FCC tribute page project.

**Thoughts**: This was one of my least productive days to date, but still a good experience. I have some more Reading-Searching-Asking to do.


### Day 19: January 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Spent my time today reading more about and practicing the use of CSS borders, margins, boxes, and the like for my tribute page.

**Thoughts**: w3schools.com is a great supplemental resource.


### Day 20: January 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: More tinkering with two of my Sonic Pi tracks.

**Thoughts**: I need a vacation.
